# Classification Setup
Two classifiers were developed:
* A classifier that was trained on Ribo-deplete and PolyA libaries, without balancing for disease prevalence (**referred to as run1**)
* A classifier that was trained on the same data, however the PolyA compendium was split to reflect the disease prevalence in Ribo-deplete libraries (**referred to as run1**)
